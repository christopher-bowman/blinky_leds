This project blinks the green LED outputs on the ArtyZ7-20 in a
binary count at approximately 1 count per second.  The Zynq
processor is not configured which will kill anything running
on them.

Type "make" to build the bit file.  This makefile is meant to run under
Linux with the vivado tools in the path.
